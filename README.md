# Appointment UI

This is the user interface of Appointment Booking App. I have used Reactjs and material-ui to built the components.

## For now it's having two pages: 

1. **Book an Appointment** : User can get the available free slots according to their Timezone and date. They can also create the event or Book the appointment by choosing the time.

2. **View Appointment** : User can get the booked appointments of a particular date range.

## Deployed App
**https://tanishkul.github.io/appointment-ui/#/**<br>

## Running Locally

**Step 1:** Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

**Step 2:** Run these commands i.e., to clone the repo and installing dependencies:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/tanishkul/appointment-ui.git
npm install
```

**Step 3:** Create a file .env for the config variables which will be same as the .env.example.
```sh
SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true
```
**STEP 4:** Start the app, using this command:
```sh
npm start
```
Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
